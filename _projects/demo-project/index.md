title: RSE2107A-Systems Engineering Project 1
description:  We are currently working on a project about designing and creating a physical environment or an arena where the LIMO robot from AgileX robotics is able to perform certain functions like navigation, mapping, path planning and localisation to navigate the maze. Our maze design will be based on Changi Airport Terminal 2. We will also be programming our LIMO robot to navigate the mazes of other teams.
skills: 
- Navigation
- Mapping
- Localisation
- Construction

{% include image-gallery.html images="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52821641477_d397e56bc4_k.jpg, https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52822650673_f074b20d90_k.jpg" height="400"%}
<span style="font-size: 10px">"Starship Test Flight Mission" from https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacex/52821641477/</span>  
You can put in multiple entries. All images will be at a fixed height in the same row. With smaller window, they will switch to columns.  

### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="project2.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}
